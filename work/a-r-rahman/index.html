    Director Baz Luhrmann said in his praise,<br> <br> 
    <i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3px fa-pull-left"></i> <em> I had come to the music of A. R. Rahman through the emotional and haunting score of Bombay and the wit and celebration of Lagaan. But the more of AR's music I encountered the more I was to be amazed at the sheer diversity of styles: from swinging brass bands to triumphant anthems; from joyous pop to West-End musicals. Whatever the style, A. R. Rahman's music always possesses a profound sense of humanity and spirit, qualities that inspire me the most.</em><i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-3px"></i>
