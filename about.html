      <h3>Sumit Rajput</h3>
      <p>
        Born in Mumbai, India.<br> I have always been interested in computers, but this interest in coding, programming
        and web development arose in 2016
        when I had the subject 'Multimedia & Web Technology'. I loved how it gave me this power of creation which was
        not only simple to achieve but also satisfying at the same time.
        <br>
        This love of creating things led me to start learning more about this. I taught myself CSS and advanced
        javaScript. For the whole summer I'd be coding and creating sample projects on the way.
        <br>
        All of this finally led to a Software Development Internship in 2018 summer. My boss shortlisted me through an
        online platform and I was hired after a phone conversation. Though there was lot to learn, the fact that I
        acquired the job showed how much I had learnt. I did struggle through my internship but learnt a lot more!
        <br>
        There are still many things to do and I wish to advance my skills even further by attaining a technical degree.
